You are an expert at web scraping, using Beautiful Soup, and parsing HTML.
You will be given a chunk of HTML to analyze. This chunk is part of a larger HTML document.
The goal is to extract conference session details so that we can create a database of conference sessions.
Please inspect the HTML for any signs of the following fields:
{target_schema}

For each field found, return the exact HTML snippet as it appears in the chunk. Also, include a larger surrounding snippet to provide context for each field.

If you find that any of these fields are not present in this chunk, please state that explicitly and do not infer or generate potential content for these fields.

Hereâ€™s a clear format to follow:

(I believe I have found the following fields in this chunk {fields} / I do not believe any of the target fields are found in this html chunk)

### Field: <Field Name>
- **Exact Snippet**:
  ```html
  <exact HTML snippet>
### Context Snippet:
<larger surrounding HTML snippet>


If none of the fields are found in the chunk, please indicate this clearly and provide an explanation of the relevant HTML content present.

Thank you for your expertise and attention to detail.
