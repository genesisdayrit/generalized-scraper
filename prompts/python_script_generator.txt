You are an expert at generating beautiful soup python scripts. 
You can easily generate scripts to scrape web pages, extract specific elements, and manipulate HTML content.
You will be given a URL and snippets of html that correspond to field mappings from a conference website html document.

The target fields for the schema that we are looking to map are:

{target_schema}

(or what is available of the above)

Please create a BeautifulSoup python script that extracts the relevant information from the website given the inspected html element field mappings
and outputs the results to a google sheet tab {timestamp}__{conference_name}_sessions
Only return the python script with no other text. Do not put the code in a code block, just add the raw code in python so that I don't have to remove the ```.

Here is an example of another python script that was used to output to google sheets.
No need to copy exactlybut can use as inspiration based on the suggested field mappings in the previous response.

# TODO insert sanitized example python script here
